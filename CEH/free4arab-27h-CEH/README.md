# CEH intro

## **Day 0**.

requirements are, familiarity with:

* VMs
* linux && bash scripting
* Kali and its disrto siblings
* linux metasploitable
* OSI Model & TCP-IP
* Microsoft AD, GPO

### VMs

because I know about them, they're addition layer with isolation and modification of an entire os above the exiting one!

### linux OS && bash scripting

You'll need to take system administration course to master these important concepts, and shell scripting bash, another course!

```sh
ifconfig # more advanced than ping
# as with
ifconfig eth0 {target_ip} # or even more as
ifconfig eth0 {target_ip} netmask {255.255.255.0} # changing its ip

ifconfig eth0 down # to stop it
ifconfig eth0 up # to start it
```

to add a default gateway, use:

```sh
route # check next one
route add default gw 192.168.3.2
```

To use a specific DNS server:

```sh
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf
```

to check existing shells, use: `cat /etc/shells`

### kali and its siblings

These are derived from unix based systems building hacking tools, some are specified to offensive security, others to defensive sec, we can say: check red, blue, black, white hats for this!

### metasploitable

metasploitable is the environment to penetration testing, filled with loopholes

they use the term `boot-to-root VMs`, a bounty to access the root after booting

### OSI Model & TCP-IP

the seven layers of networking machines, **OSI Model**:

1. Physical
1. Data link
1. Network
1. Transport
1. Session
1. Presentation
1. Application

**TCP-ip** is the shortened term (protocol) you saw in byteByteGo:

1. Network access
1. Internet
1. Host-to-host
1. Application (latest 3 layers combined)

> Tutor's ordered them in descending order.

Layer 7 `Application` is not the applications we use, it's the base of protocols that handles the apps, http?s, ftp?s ssl/tls, dhcp, snmp, telnet, tftp=>`as .env files`, etc...; aka: `Services protocols`.

Layer 6 `Presentation` formatting files and their extensions, `extensions are protocols!`

Layer 5 `Session` handling data between notes, as with `RPC`, `VNC`.

Layer 4 `Transport` 7th layer can't do its jobs without these two protocols of transport: `TCP/UDP`, http => tcp; in this layer we chunk data into `segments` and attach `header` to each, which is `TCP/UDP` header, headers include two important parts, source port Number => **S port#** && destination **D port #**. eg: `d port# 80`, `s port#60000` s as random of 16b => 2^16, 0-1023 => *well known ports*, `ip add + port number = socket` as `255.255.255.255`, it can be found in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\services` windows, it contains good data of ports!

Layer 3 `Network` here we send many sockets in one packet, each packet has a header with network protocol named `IP`, each header also has S/D ports, meaning, inside each socket and each outer Packet, packets => `S IP Address, D IP Address`, if services file contains 2 versions, IPv4, IPv6 for a host, it'll format to IPv6, as localhost: `127.0.0.1` to `::1`

Layer 2 `Data Link` all prior data is contained to `frame`s, based on the type of network, eth has mac Addr, each frame has a header, & a tail, tails have: `CRC` checks data scale/length with `MTU` => *maximum transition until* tutor's said it's 1500 byte, 1.5Kb to most interfaces. similar to checksum but checksum is in each header, in each layer, and checksum checks header's status. frames have in headers: `S MAC, D MAC` s/d mac address, written in HEX, 12 hex, in bits 48, Physical addr === mac addr, as `00-15-5D-EA-60-B5` 12hex, first 4 sets, `00-15-5D` represents the manufacture company = `vendor/OUI`, others for the machine, asking `IANA` to register these MAC addresses, [check this](http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers/ethernet-numbers.xhtml), to get the Destination MAC, we go to layer 3 and get `ARP`, there are other protocols in l3: `IGMP`, `ICMP`, ARP should get data from both packet & Frame to bring the D mac, `if we poison this ARP in pc's files as in arp -a we can do man in the middle attack`

Layer 1 `Physical` converting data into bits to compute them, academically, they call each layer's data as `protocol data unit PDU`

---

TCP has 6 common flags commonly used, to do tcp `three way hand shake`

![alt text](assets/tcp-flags.png)

ðŸ”´ Scanning techniques are built on top of these TCP flags, wireSharp -> `sniffing tool` && `network monitoring analyzer`, uses them ðŸ”´ and it tells everything we learned about segments, packets, sockets, syn msgs etc...

Even DoS, PDoS are related to this, but with knowing `sequence number`, `stateful firewall` ,and `open ports`

Check this full open session: ![alt text](assets/tcp-three-way-hand-shake.png)

a vulnerability is that when client sends syn msg, and host res with syn/ack msg, host waits for ack! `type of DoS attacks are playing on this, changing the S ip on each third step! half open session`

seq is seq++ on each handling, ISP uses windowing on this to lower internet speed!

stateful/stateless firewalls:

* stateless => preventing data via: source destination, ip addrs, port #, S dest, protocol type!
* stateful = stateless + logging data!

Stateful firewalls can view the MITM (man in the middle) attacks, via these logs!

as when transmitting data is finished a:b using FIN flag, then MITM attacker tries with it, it says no, because I got fin and sent fin-ack

### Microsoft AD, GPO

using windows server as v2012, it works to make local windows machines act as servers with their domain

```sh
domain
baderidris.com

DC1 => domain controler # has role of AD DC => active Dir Domain Service, defaults to have DNS aside to it
pc1.baderidris.com
user bader password secret

# the AD is a database to have roles, fields are called forests, in NTDS/ntds.dit file
```

there's a loophole in saving users data in that pc1 machine with windows server OSs, because it saves them with 10 tries as a backup to losing connection with the domain, it'll have `SAM && ntds.dit` copies, Default behavior

users are called `Object`s, role == class, privileges == attributes

creating another user in the same forest, is called tree

Finished day 0, 2:17:50 : 27H ðŸ˜±

## day 1 CEH concepts

![alt text](assets/CEH.png)

![alt text](assets/day1/vunerability.png)

unknown attacks are considered 0 day attacks!

majority of vulnerabilities are measured with `Common vulnerability Scoring System` CVSS calculator of their severity.

Types of attacks:

* OS Attacks
* Misconfiguration Attacks
* Application Level Attacks
* Shrink wrap code Attacks

These are the core objectives of security:

* Availability
* Integrity
* Confidentiality

> We need to protect hardware, software and stored data!

![alt text](assets/day1/confidentiality.png)

Integrity is used too much by programmers like me: DevOps and backend Engineers! as in hashing passwords, encrypting data, etc...

Availability contains: load balancing, multi-nodes, backups, RAID modes also used in my backend industry.

![alt text](assets/day1/hacker-classes.png)

70% of attacks occur because of internal weaknesses, and 80% of hackers are script kiddies, boys who copy some steps and tries them out!

That's why tutor's saying kali is for script kiddies, because professionals use specific tools to their needs!

![alt text](assets/day1/apt-types.png)

Check [defCon](https://defcon.org/) website for hacking resources

### Hacking phases

1. Reconnaissance
2. Scanning
3. Gaining Access
4. Maintaining Access
5. Clearing Track

![at 2:46:30](assets/day1/hacking-phase-1.png)

![alt text](assets/day1/hacking-phase-2.png)

![alt text](assets/day1/hacking-phase-3.png)

Enumeration happens in phase 3, not as hackTheBox started with, They are using CH school curriculum, that's why they started in Enumeration!

![alt text](assets/day1/hacking-phase-4.png)

![2:51:23](assets/day1/hacking-phase-5.png)

ðŸ”´ Those 5 phases are from `EC council`, another school is `The cyber kill chain` naming the phases with other naming. 7 steps! ðŸ”´

> What's ethical hacking?

And what's IA => information assurance, it's the process of assuring the integrity, security, confidentiality and authority of data are protected during: `usage`, `storage` and `transmission`!

We do it by conducting:

* Risk Management
* Policies
* Physical Security
* Pen Testing
* Performance Certification && accreditation
* Training && awareness

Then using containerization and Certbot with my application is of these approaches!

---

Security Control types:

* Technical (Logical) Control
* Administrative (Soft) Control
* Physical Control

each of these three provide 7 different Fns || types:

1. Preventative controls
1. Detective controls
1. Corrective controls
1. Determent controls
1. Recovery controls
1. Compensative controls
1. Directive controls [Regulations]

![alt text](assets/day1/risk-management.png)

One of the important Risk Assessment tools: `Threat modeling`, and the best app for it as tutor's said: `microsoft threat modeling`, it's a good drawing tool, with predefined icons of OS. similar to the new `SNYK` tool

tangible and non-tangible assets, and their risks of being lost, that's the measuring of risk management

![3:11:10](assets/day1/asset-value.png)

An important concept to measure how risky are the threats and even the value of the company itself.

![alt text](assets/day1/information-security-policies.png)

Some military policies follow Paranoid Policy, which forbids everything!

a good resource for examples of these security policies [is:](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/) `sans.org` it contains PDF files on each topic.

Some payment policies good to be in our app is as `PCI-DSS` to have the credentials to our costumers! This is in `Regulation` section!

![alt text](assets/day1/regulation-standards-framework.png)

BHI and BII are good to look up for business regulations!
Also Check for AUP => `Applicable Use Policy`, when we ask uses to accept our terms.

![alt text](assets/day1/governance.png)

> *Compliance is Mandatory for Policy*

Guidelines

Its general instructions , its Discretionary , its Do that & Not that.
Its advices for how organization objectives might be obtained.
Its has no meaning without adding to it Procedures.

**Procedures**

Its How-To instructions for success.
Its details written in **Step-by-Step** format.
It include "Best Practice" suggested to develop your own procedures.

Compliance is Mandatory for procedures

These topics are all important in the CEH exam!

incident management

Incident management is a set of defined processes to identify, analyze, prioritize, and resolve
security incidents to restore normal service operations as quickly as possible and prevent future
recurrence of the incident.

## Module 2 footprinting && Reconnaissance 3:26:40

| # | Footprinting Methodology |
|---|-------------------------|
| 1 | Footprinting through Search Engines |
| 2 | Footprinting Using Advanced Google Hacking Techniques |
| 3 | Footprinting through Social Networking Sites |

| 9 | Network Footprinting |
| 10 | Footprinting through Social Engineering |

### 1 through Search Engines

check these web applications for foorprinting:

* spiderFoot
* ShowDan
* cenSys

A great thing about the 2nd/3rd ones, is that they try as possible to appear the stack of targeted site!

### 2 Using Advanced Google Hacking Techniques

![alt text](assets/module2/google-Techniques.png)

examples:

Some people misuse their cameras, so we can find them using advanced searching as in google: `intitle:webcam7 inurl:8080 -intext:8080`

> check Google hacking penetration testing Book

### 3 Footprinting through Social Networking Sites

Kali developers: offensive security, have [exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) they put latest data on tips of google advance searching ðŸ”´

### 4 website Footprinting

![alt text](assets/module2/footprinting-website.png)

most of the websites are preventing web scramming, so this technique is not that useful nowadays

### 5 email Footprinting

Open the source of the sent email, focus on email header

![alt text](assets/module2/footprinting-email.png)

Another good resource for it is: `ip2location.com`, also `ipLocatdion`, `email tracker pro`

### 6 Competitive Intelligence

Tutor passed it

### 7 WHOIS Footprinting

![alt text](assets/module2/footprinting-whois.png)

### 8 DNS Footprinting

![alt text](assets/module2/footprinting-DNS.png)

good tools for it: `dig` => domain information groper, `nslookup` and `host`

### 9 Network Footprinting

![alt text](assets/module2/footprinting-network.png)

### 10 Footprinting through Social Engineering

watch catch me if you can to get it, some tools `maltego`

![4:18:00](assets/module2/footprinting-social-engineering.png)

32 steps, specified for pen testers

## practical footprinting 4:34:00

an important tool for doing footprinting is `host`

```sh
host --help

# some networking fixes:
ifconfig eth0 up
ifconfig eth0 192.168.3.128/24 # <check-options>
route add default gw 192.168.3.2 # check it out
ping 8.8.8.8
## >>------------------------<<

host -t mx darkmatter.ae
# the pick one of its domains, then
host -t a mx3.zoho.com # host -t a <domain>
# this will provide website's ip
host -t ns darkmatter.ae # ns -> name server
# to check if they have IPv^ add aaaa
host -t aaaa darkmatter.ae
```

Another good command is `theharvester`, for same purpose

```sh
theharvester -d darkmatter.ae -b google > smFile # -d => domain, -b dataSource
```

Another great tool for checking load balancing is: `lbd`, for many levels, it might get the 7 lvls explained in system design book

```sh
lbd microsoft.com # or > smFile
lbd microsoft.com > smFile
```

An important to understand the framework of metasploit is `recon-ng`

```sh
# starts with >
recon-ng
workspaces add SM_Name # to redirect from default one
workspaces list # it uses SQL db
workspaces select SM_Name
help
show modules # to get all listed modules/Fns
use recon/domains-vulnerabilities/xssposed
show options
# here we need to change its value, because it defaults to default for domains
set SOURCE cbtme.com
show options
run # important for cross site scripting checking
# to go back use this, not c^z or c^c
back

add domains darkmatter.ae
add domains www.darkmatter.ae

show domains
use recon/domains-contacts/pgp-search
show options
# we can run, it'll sue the two set domains above
run
# it'll try getting emails from that app
load reporting/json

set CREATOR bader
set CUSTOMER DM
set FILENAME ~/Desktop/reporting.json
run
```

we can also use `dig` to view some good details about servers

```sh
dig cbtme.com A
```

## Module 3 Scanning Networks 5:02:00

Objectives of Network Scanning!

* To discover live hosts, IP address, and open ports of live hosts
* To discover operating systems â€¢nd system architecture
* To discover services running on hosts
* To discover vulnerabilities in live hosts

Scan types

![alt text](assets/module3/scan-types.png)

two important tips, `scan ips` & `run a sniffer as wireShark`

three tools to do TCP manipulation/creation: `colasoft` `scapy` `Hping`
