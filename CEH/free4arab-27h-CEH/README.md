# CEH intro

## **Day 0**.

requirements are, familiarity with:

* VMs
* linux && bash scripting
* Kali and its disrto siblings
* linux metasploitable
* OSI Model & TCP-IP
* Microsoft AD, GPO

### VMs

because I know about them, they're addition layer with isolation and modification of an entire os above the exiting one!

### linux OS && bash scripting

You'll need to take system administration course to master these important concepts, and shell scripting bash, another course!

```sh
ifconfig # more advanced than ping
# as with
ifconfig eth0 {target_ip} # or even more as
ifconfig eth0 {target_ip} netmask {255.255.255.0} # changing its ip

ifconfig eth0 down # to stop it
ifconfig eth0 up # to start it
```

to add a default gateway, use:

```sh
route # check next one
route add default gw 192.168.3.2
```

To use a specific DNS server:

```sh
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf
```

to check existing shells, use: `cat /etc/shells`

### kali and its siblings

These are derived from unix based systems building hacking tools, some are specified to offensive security, others to defensive sec, we can say: check red, blue, black, white hats for this!

### metasploitable

metasploitable is the environment to penetration testing, filled with loopholes

they use the term `boot-to-root VMs`, a bounty to access the root after booting

### OSI Model & TCP-IP

the seven layers of networking machines, **OSI Model**:

1. Physical
1. Data link
1. Network
1. Transport
1. Session
1. Presentation
1. Application

**TCP-ip** is the shortened term (protocol) you saw in byteByteGo:

1. Network access
1. Internet
1. Host-to-host
1. Application (latest 3 layers combined)

> Tutor's ordered them in descending order.

Layer 7 `Application` is not the applications we use, it's the base of protocols that handles the apps, http?s, ftp?s ssl/tls, dhcp, snmp, telnet, tftp=>`as .env files`, etc...; aka: `Services protocols`.

Layer 6 `Presentation` formatting files and their extensions, `extensions are protocols!`

Layer 5 `Session` handling data between notes, as with `RPC`, `VNC`.

Layer 4 `Transport` 7th layer can't do its jobs without these two protocols of transport: `TCP/UDP`, http => tcp; in this layer we chunk data into `segments` and attach `header` to each, which is `TCP/UDP` header, headers include two important parts, source port Number => **S port#** && destination **D port #**. eg: `d port# 80`, `s port#60000` s as random of 16b => 2^16, 0-1023 => *well known ports*, `ip add + port number = socket` as `255.255.255.255`, it can be found in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\services` windows, it contains good data of ports!

Layer 3 `Network` here we send many sockets in one packet, each packet has a header with network protocol named `IP`, each header also has S/D ports, meaning, inside each socket and each outer Packet, packets => `S IP Address, D IP Address`, if services file contains 2 versions, IPv4, IPv6 for a host, it'll format to IPv6, as localhost: `127.0.0.1` to `::1`

Layer 2 `Data Link` all prior data is contained to `frame`s, based on the type of network, eth has mac Addr, each frame has a header, & a tail, tails have: `CRC` checks data scale/length with `MTU` => *maximum transition until* tutor's said it's 1500 byte, 1.5Kb to most interfaces. similar to checksum but checksum is in each header, in each layer, and checksum checks header's status. frames have in headers: `S MAC, D MAC` s/d mac address, written in HEX, 12 hex, in bits 48, Physical addr === mac addr, as `00-15-5D-EA-60-B5` 12hex, first 4 sets, `00-15-5D` represents the manufacture company = `vendor/OUI`, others for the machine, asking `IANA` to register these MAC addresses, [check this](http://www.iana.org/assignments/ethernet-numbers/ethernet-numbers.xhtml), to get the Destination MAC, we go to layer 3 and get `ARP`, there are other protocols in l3: `IGMP`, `ICMP`, ARP should get data from both packet & Frame to bring the D mac, `if we poison this ARP in pc's files as in arp -a we can do man in the middle attack`

Layer 1 `Physical` converting data into bits to compute them, academically, they call each layer's data as `protocol data unit PDU`

---

TCP has 6 common flags commonly used, to do tcp `three way hand shake`

![alt text](assets/tcp-flags.png)

ðŸ”´ Scanning techniques are built on top of these TCP flags, wireSharp -> `sniffing tool` && `network monitoring analyzer`, uses them ðŸ”´ and it tells everything we learned about segments, packets, sockets, syn msgs etc...

Even DoS, PDoS are related to this, but with knowing `sequence number`, `stateful firewall` ,and `open ports`

Check this full open session: ![alt text](assets/tcp-three-way-hand-shake.png)

a vulnerability is that when client sends syn msg, and host res with syn/ack msg, host waits for ack! `type of DoS attacks are playing on this, changing the S ip on each third step! half open session`

seq is seq++ on each handling, ISP uses windowing on this to lower internet speed!

stateful/stateless firewalls:

* stateless => preventing data via: source destination, ip addrs, port #, S dest, protocol type!
* stateful = stateless + logging data!

Stateful firewalls can view the MITM (man in the middle) attacks, via these logs!

as when transmitting data is finished a:b using FIN flag, then MITM attacker tries with it, it says no, because I got fin and sent fin-ack

### Microsoft AD, GPO

using windows server as v2012, it works to make local windows machines act as servers with their domain

```sh
domain
baderidris.com

DC1 => domain controler # has role of AD DC => active Dir Domain Service, defaults to have DNS aside to it
pc1.baderidris.com
user bader password secret

# the AD is a database to have roles, fields are called forests, in NTDS/ntds.dit file
```

there's a loophole in saving users data in that pc1 machine with windows server OSs, because it saves them with 10 tries as a backup to losing connection with the domain, it'll have `SAM && ntds.dit` copies, Default behavior

users are called `Object`s, role == class, privileges == attributes

creating another user in the same forest, is called tree

## day 1 CEH concepts

![alt text](assets/CEH.png)

![alt text](assets/day1/vunerability.png)

unknown attacks are considered 0 day attacks!

majority of vulnerabilities are measured with `Common vulnerability Scoring System` CVSS calculator of their severity.

Types of attacks:

* OS Attacks
* Misconfiguration Attacks
* Application Level Attacks
* Shrink wrap code Attacks

These are the core objectives of security:

* Availability
* Integrity
* Confidentiality

> We need to protect hardware, software and stored data!

![alt text](assets/day1/confidentiality.png)

Integrity is used too much by programmers like me: DevOps and backend Engineers! as in hashing passwords, encrypting data, etc...

Availability contains: load balancing, multi-nodes, backups, RAID modes also used in my backend industry.

![alt text](assets/day1/hacker-classes.png)

70% of attacks occur because of internal weaknesses, and 80% of hackers are script kiddies, boys who copy some steps and tries them out!

That's why tutor's saying kali is for script kiddies, because professionals use specific tools to their needs!

### Hacking phases

Enumeration happens in phase 3, not as hackTheBox started with, They are using CH school curriculum, that's why they started in Enumeration!

![alt text](assets/day1/hacking-phase-4.png)

![2:51:23](assets/day1/hacking-phase-5.png)

ðŸ”´ Those 5 phases are from `EC council`, another school is `The cyber kill chain` naming the phases with other naming. 7 steps! ðŸ”´
